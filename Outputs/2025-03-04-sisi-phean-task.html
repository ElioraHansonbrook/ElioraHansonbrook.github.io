<p>Al Jazeera reports on the details of Egypt’s plan to redevelop Gaza, which was adopted yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first stage would last about six months, while the next two phases would take place over a combined four to five years... Once the roads are clear, 200.000 temporary housing units would be built to accommodate 1.2 million people and about 60,000 damaged buildings restored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between American President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu, rebuilding Gaza in an internationally acceptable way was always going to be a difficult task.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s proposal to redevelop the Gaza Strip as a “Riviera of the Middle East” by kicking all the residents out is an obvious non-starter. In contrast, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi’s $53 billion reconstruction plan seemed downright reasonable, and practically destined to garner regional support.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-04-2025-35f1959c28ad3c57a209f5464f2b5411">adoption of the plan</a> by Arab League countries is an obvious win for President Sisi, but he isn’t out of the woods yet. Even as Mr. Sisi has consolidated support in the Arab World, its relationship with Israel is suffering.</p>
<p>Mr. Sisi has deployed troops to the Sinai Penninusla, and although both Israel and Egypt deny that they intend declare war, there is almost endless (and, in my analysis, rather ridiculous) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/middleeast/israel-egypt-war-gaza-intl/index.html">media speculation</a> about the possibility. Nevertheless, there is little question that their national relationship is weakening.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Mr. Trump successfully goes through with his plan, and expels the population of Gaza into Egypt and other Arab countries, Mr. Sisi will have to deal with a whole new set of problems. Thus, Egypt is stuck in a place where every step it takes to protect its interests, further endangers its relationship with one of its most important allies. Regardless of whatever small gains Egypt manages to eke out of this horrible situtation, Mr. Sisi seems destined to be worse off after this crisis than he was before.</p>

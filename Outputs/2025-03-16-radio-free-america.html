<h3>Radio Free America</h3>
<p>During the height of the Cold War, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty worked to provide accurate news coverage to countries under the shadow of the Iron Curtain. Although the organizations were created to advance American political interests, they became more than that. Staffed by dissidents who had fled the Eastern Bloc, the organizations effectively served as a free press for people who weren’t free.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union and the democratization of much of Europe, the organizations were merged together. The combined organization, R.F.E./R.L., which continues to be funded by the United States Congress, works to provide an unbiased, trustworthy newssource to people suffering under the stifling blanket of autocracy the world over. Today, <a href="https://about.rferl.org/about-rfe-rl/">according to the organization</a>, it provides a free press service to nearly 50 million people every week. It has defied totalitarian regimes <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/Czech_Intelligence_Reveals_Iraqi_Plot_To_Attack_RFERL/1891512.html">at great risk</a> to its remarkably brave and dedicated staff.</p>
<p>Authoritarians from around the world have fought to be rid of R.F.E./R.L. for decades. On Saturday, the Trump Administration gave them their wish, and <a href="https://about.rferl.org/article/rfe-rl-president-defunding-would-be-massive-gift-to-americas-enemies/">cancelled</a> the organization’s funding.</p>

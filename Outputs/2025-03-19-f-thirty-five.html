<h3>People Thought the F-35 Looked Bad, But it was Just Being Stealthy</h3>
<p>The F-35 has long been derided by observers of the military-industrial complex. Construction, maintenance, and flight costs were alleged to be too high, even as the aircraft has proved itself vastly superior to its competition.</p>
<p>As F-35 production and use have ramped up, not only have real costs come down, but <a href="https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/03/the-f-35-fighter-question-that-lingers-year-after-year/">nominal prices have</a>, too. Although the trends are not guaranteed to hold, the F-35 is looking like a better and better investment as Lockheed Martinâ€™s economies of scale increase.</p>
<p>But those economies of scale may halt in the near future. U.S. allies are considering the cancellation of their F-35 orders as the U.S. erraticism grows under President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, who has threatened key American allies with not only tariffs, but actual invasion, is fundamentally destabilizing American alliances around the world. One of the many side-effects of his actions may be a reduction of F-35 production and resultantly higher prices.</p>

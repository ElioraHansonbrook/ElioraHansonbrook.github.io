<p>Right now, the Trump Administration is showing us exactly why the First Amendment exists. I would say that “democracy dies in darkness,” but the Washington Post has exemplified exactly the sort of cowardice that this article identifies. Because of Hayekian limitations, censorship is only effective when a critical mass of people censor themselves.</p>

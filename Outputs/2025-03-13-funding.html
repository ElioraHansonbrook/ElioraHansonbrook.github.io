<h3>Fun with Funding the Government</h3>
<p>The New York Times is reporting that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/government-shutdown-senate-democrats.html?smid=url-share">backing</a> the passage of the continuing resolution to fund the government. Mr. Schumer asserts that if the bill is not passed, President Trump will be able to further centralize power around himself.</p>
<p>I think that Mr. Schumer’s instincts are correct. Given the speed with which the Trump Administration has radically transformed the government, it seems likely that a shutdown could be used as a pretense to fire more civil servants and further centralize power around Mr. Trump. In fact, if there were a shutdown, it is plausible that rather than sending people home from work for a few days or weeks, the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” would simply terminate their employment.</p>
<p>While the continuing resolution does <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/11/congress/house-republicans-move-to-block-vote-on-trumps-tariffs-00223947">reduce congressional ability</a> to check the executive branch, electoral politics also matter. Although a display of bipartisanship may not increase support for the Democrats, filibustering the continuing resolution would surely feature in future Republican campaign ads. The Party has axiomatically committed itself to making government work; this is one of the times when it needs to do so.</p>

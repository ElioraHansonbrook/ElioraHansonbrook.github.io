<p>Building one’s own website is far more simple than one might expect. It’s also far more complicated.</p>
<p>Designing a website is simple because HTML and CSS are designed to fail softly; a misplaced semicolon or triangle bracket doesn’t cause your code to stop working (although it probably causes something on your website to look wrong). Generating much of my HTML with a custom Python script I threw together means that adjustments to my design easily propagate across my website.</p>
<p>On the flipside, however, getting the website perfect takes far more effort than you might expect: every letter has to be carefully weighed, each ornament fully considered. Because my Python script recreates my entire website every time it runs, my design has to be thought out enough to work with content I have not yet created.</p>
<p>When I created this website, I thought the design would be a small weekend project. Instead, I’ve spent copious amounts of time researching independent website design in order to perfect this site. Resources like <a href="https://32bit.cafe/websiteideas/">32-Bit Cafe</a> and <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas">James’ Coffee Blog</a> have been invaluable in inspiring me to improve by blog. Developing a design which is accessible, modern, and distinctive is a serious design task.</p>
<p>There are many invisible changes also going underneath the surface. Over the past few weeks I’ve added appropriate meta tags to my pages; created an RSS feed, and added structured data. All of these changes were implemented with no visible change to the user experience. Visually I’ve made some adjustments as well. In addition to fixing some HTML bugs from my initial website design session, I added support for dark mode at the request of one of my readers.</p>
<p>After several weeks of putting out a single long article each week, I decided to try something new this week and put out smaller posts periodically. Although I originally intended to link to individual articles elsewhere on the Internet, my format seems to have somewhat evolved into a series of mini-essays. I’m not entirely sure how these short articles will continue to develop (or if they will at all), but I’ve really surprised myself with how much more I’ve added to my blog this week. Writing about the news isn’t just cathartic; writing things out helps strengthen my analyses.</p>
<p>Blogging a lot this week isn’t the only thing that’s surprised me. I have actual, real-life, people who – get this – <em>read</em> my blog. If you’ve been following my blog for the past month, you know that I didn’t create this blog in order to syndicate my ideas across the Internet; I created it so that I would have<a href="https://hansonbrook.com/Posts/2025-02-02-two-weeks.html"> an emotional and creative outlet</a>. Although my readership is miniscule compared to the number of people on the web, knowing that even a handful of people care enough to read my blog and write me feedback means the world to me.</p>
<p>There are plenty of additional tasks for me to take on, of course. I want my website to have a slightly more distinctive personality, for example. I’m also concerned that the front page (which I’ve been calling “The Feed“) is not accessible enough.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this first month of writing and managing a blog has been a delight.</p>

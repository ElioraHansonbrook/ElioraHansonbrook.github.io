## This Blog
Eliora created this blog in February 2025, opting to write a Python script to procedurally generate it from a collection of Markdown files, rather than using a standard C.M.S. Although the code is available on GitHub, it is not production quality, and does not conform to standard Python conventions.
Unlike the code powering this site, all content featured in the blog conforms to a strict [style guide](https://hansonbrook.com/styleGuide) and is regularly updated. A new long-form post at least once a week, with shorter pieces being posted periodically. Since this blog is an ongoing, *ad hoc* affair, its development often takes [unexpected](https://hansonbrook.com/Posts/2025-03-07-building-this-blog) turns. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please feel free to contact Eliora using the "contact me" link.

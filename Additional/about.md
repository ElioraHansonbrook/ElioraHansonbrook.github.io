## This Blog
This blog was created as a weekend project in February 2025. It is procedurally generated using a Python script and a whole lotta Markdown. Although the code is available on GitHub, it is not production quality, and does not conform to standard Python conventions.
New long-form posts are published at least once a week. Shorter pieces are posted periodically.

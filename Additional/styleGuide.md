# Style Guide
This style guide ensures spelling and grammatical decisions remain consistent between articles. Please note that the style guide is a living document; it will be updated on an as-needed basis.

## Acronyms
Acronyms whose letters are individually pronounced have periods placed between each letter. All other acronyms do not have periods between their letters.

## Ambiguous Definitions
A number of words have multiple meanings. To avoid confusion, the following table standardizes the usage of words.

| Word | Meaning and Usage |
| --- | --- |
| Country | A sovereign state recognized by the global state system. |
| State | To avoid confusion between American states and sovereign states, this term should generally be avoided. |

## Capitalization
Capitalization should generally follow standard English capitalization rules.

- The first word in each sentence is capitalized.
- Proper nouns are capitalized. Regular nouns are capitalized when used as a proper noun.
- The pronoun 'I' is capitalized.
- A title is capitalized only when used as part of a compound proper noun.

## Countries
The first reference to a country in any given post or tidbit must use its primary name. Further references to the country may choose between the primary name, the acronym, or the secondary name.

*This list only references countries and proposed countries which have been mentioned on this blog. It will be updated as needed.*

| Primary Name | Acronym | Secondary Name | Adjectival |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canada | --- | --- | Canadian |
| Federal Republic of Germany | --- | Germany | German |
| France | --- | --- | French |
| Hungary | --- | --- | Hungarian |
| Iraq | --- | --- | Iraqi |
| Israel | --- | --- | Israeli |
| Mexico | --- | --- | Mexican |
| Kurdistan | --- | --- | Kurdish |
| People's Republic of China | P.R.C. | China | Chinese |

| Russian Federation | --- | Russia | Russian |
| Serbia | --- | --- | Serbian |
| Syria | --- | --- | Syrian |

## Italics
The following items should be italicized:

- The title of a book, movie, album, or other creative work 
- A thought
- An untranslated phrase from another language, including phrases often used in English (i.e. *coup d'état*)

Italics should be avoided in all other circumstances.

## Lists
When writing comma-separated lists, the serial comma appears prior to the word "and" or "or." When writing semicolon-separated lists, a semicolon and the word "and" or "or" should precede the final entry.

## Names
Any person mentioned in a post should initially be referred to by their full name and title(s). If their title is in a national government, the title should be preceded by the appropriate denonym (i.e. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney).
For second and later mentions, an honorific, such as "Ms.", should precede a last name. If a person's title may be used as an honorific in normal usage, it may also do so in a post.

## Numbers
Numbers zero through twenty should be spelled out. Numbers with a value of 21 or greater should be written with arabic numerals.

## Possession
In singular words that end with the letter 's', possession is indicated by appending the suffix "-'s".

## Preferred Terms
Some terms are preferred over others. This table lists terms which should be replaced by preferred terms.

| Preferred Term | Other Terms |
| --- | --- |
| (the) First World War | WWI, World War One, the Great War |
| (the) Second World War | WWII, World War Two |

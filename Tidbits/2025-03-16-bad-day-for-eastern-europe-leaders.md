### Bad Day for Eastern European Leaders Who Hate Protests
Two different Eastern European leaders saw mass protests calling for their resignations yesterday: [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán](https://www.diepresse.com/19474914/viktor-orban-ausgepfiffen-massen-bei-protest-in-budapest) and [Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/europe/serbia-protest-president-vucic.html). The demonstration in Belgrade likely saw somewhere between 100,000 and one million protesters. The protest in Budapest saw [at least](https://www.rferl.org/a/hungary-magyar-orban-protests/33349014.html) 50,000.
While it is unlikely that either leader will step down before their next election, it is astounding to see this kind of popular protest against authoritarian leaders materializing in countries which had heretofore been far more tolerant of them.
In my ideal world, these protests would foretell a coming decline in global authoritarian sentiment. In reality, they will almost certainly prove little more than a blip in global media coverage.

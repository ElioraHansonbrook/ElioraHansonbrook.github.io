### The State of Sudan
The Sudanese military has now [mostly recaptured](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/21/sudans-army-retakes-presidential-palace-in-khartoum-strikes-blow-to-rsf) Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, from the Rapid Support Forces (R.S.F.). The rebel group, which the United States has [accused](https://apnews.com/article/biden-sudan-genocide-7a0d20f857af3fd428750cf2dfd231ae) of genocide, has been fighting against the Sudanese government since April 2023. Tens of thousands of civilians have died since the beginning of the war, and, although the R.S.F. has lost Khartoum, it seems unlikely that the war will conclude in the near future.
Although the entire Sahel region has been dominated by civil war for the past two years, the conflict in Sudan stands out as particularly horrific. The war is remarkably complex, involving both major global actors, such as the Russian Federation and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Sudan's [neighboring countries](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-sudan-chad-condemn-sudanese-generals-threats-attack-them-2025-03-24/) of South Sudan and the Republic of Chad. Despite limited coverage in Western media, this war stands out in a world increasingly consumed by armed conflict.
I'm hoping to write a longer piece about the conflict at some point in the future, but for now I would strongly recommend [this piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/africa/sudan-civil-war-khartoum.html) in The New York Times.

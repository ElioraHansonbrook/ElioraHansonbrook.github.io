### Phase Two Ceasefire Struggles
It seems utterly unsurprising that Israel and Hamas are [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-trump-ukraine.html) to come to a deal on the second phase of the ceasefire. Each side in the negotiations has fundamentally incompatible demands; although war is not beneficial to the aims of either Israel or Hamas (hence the continuing ceasefire), neither side has been put in a position where it needs to concede core negotiation points.
That's not to say there aren't compelling humanitarian reasons to want an end to the war. Israel's twelve-day total blockade of Gaza, designed to put pressure on Hamas, is more likely to [harm civilians](https://aje.io/ejvazw?update=3577032) than combatants.
Ultimately, however, it seems unlikely that the negotiations in Qatar are going to yield results in the short term; despite an exchange of prisoners and hostages, the Israel-Hamas relation remains almost an entirely zero-sum game. From a realist perspective, this failure of negotiation is nothing if not expected. From a humanitarian perspective, though, it's a tragedy.

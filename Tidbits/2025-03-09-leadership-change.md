### Leadership Change in Canada
Mark Carney will [become the next prime minister of Canada](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/canada/mark-carney-liberal-election.html) later this week, after he was elected the leader of the countryâ€™s Liberal Party. Mr. Carney, who is expected to hold snap elections shortly after he becomes the Canadian premier, will replace the [remarkably unpopular](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/justin-trudeau-steps-down-unpopular-13850591.html) Justin Trudeau.
Mr. Carney's foreign policy positions are not yet well delineated. His opposition to Brexit and plans to increase Canadian military spending to pass NATO's [two percent threshold](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-leadership-contender-mark-carney-defence-spending-1.7450718) seem indicative of a liberal internationalist approach, but because of his lack of previous foreign policy experience, it is difficult to be certain.
While Mr. Carney has previously expressed support for initiatives bringing the West together, he did make a number of  statements critical of American President Donald Trump while campaigning. While Mr. Carney's comments were likely designed to consolidate political support, Mr. Trump may not see it that way. It seems plausible, in fact, that the mercurial Mr. Trump may intensify his attacks on Canada as as a response to perceived disrespect from Mr. Carney.
On domestic matters, Mr. Carney plans to scrap Canada's [carbon tax program](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-to-scrap-carbon-tax-1.7446908) and replace it with a semi-protectionist tax on imports from climate-unfriendly countries. Much like leaders who have recently ascended to power in other Western nations, Mr. Carney has criticized immigration policy and called for a [reduction in immigration](https://financialpost.com/news/economy/mark-carney-says-canadas-immigration-policy-suffered-failures-of-execution).
Beyond his policies, Mr. Carney brings a remarkable degree of economic expertise to his new job. A graduate of Harvard and Oxford Universities, he is [the only person](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mark-carney-crisis-fighting-central-banker-hopes-lead-canada-through-trade-war-2025-03-07/) to have headed the central bank of two separate G7 countries. Yet despite that expertise, his lack of experience as a politician, and with foreign affairs, may ultimately prove too great of a hindrance to overcome.
After Mr. Trudeau's resignation, the Liberal Party has seen a [significant surge](https://globalnews.ca/news/11034743/liberals-lead-poll-federal-vote-feb-25/) in the polls. If the shift in polling holds, the Liberal Party will win its next election; Mr. Carney may well be Canada's prime minister for years to come.

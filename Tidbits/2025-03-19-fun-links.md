### Some Fun Links
One of the great things about being on break is that I've been able to step back, work on some independent projects, and read some interesting things. Here are some things you may be interested in:

1. ["Greener Cities, Safer Streets? Exploring the Impact of Green Spaces on Crime"](https://medium.com/@madrona.amelie/greener-cities-safer-streets-exploring-the-impact-of-green-spaces-on-crime-f0f8a9c56516) by Bottinelli et al.
    *I don't have enormous confidence in this study, since it wasn't peer-reviewed, but it's an easy and interesting read. It claims that green space does not actually impact crime rates.*
2. *The Aeneid* by Virgil
    *There are some great scenes in the Aeneid, although the quality can be quite variable. The fall of Troy section is absolutely fantastic, though.*
    
3. ["The Stages of Trumpist Economic Grief"](https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-stages-of-trumpist-economic-grief) by Paul Krugman
    *Dr. Krugman discusses the changing narrative on the economy presented by members of the Trump Administration*

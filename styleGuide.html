<h1>Style Guide</h1>
<p>This style guide ensures spelling and grammatical decisions remain consistent between articles. Please note that the style guide is a living document; it will be updated on an as-needed basis.</p>
<h2>Abbreviations</h2>
<ul>
<li>In general, acronyms whose letters are individually pronounced should have each letter written as a capital letter followed by a period. (e.g. The United States may be abbreviated U.S.)</li>
<li>Programming language names, however, should be written with all capital letters but no periods, regardless of how they are pronounced.</li>
<li>All other acronyms are written with capital letters, but do not incorporate any periods.</li>
<li>Unit abbreviations should be written all lower case, with a single period following the completed abbreviation. Unit abbreviations should only follow arabic numerals. (e.g. 33 inches might be written “33 in.”, but three inches would be written as “three inches“)</li>
<li>Abbreviations for Latin phrases should be written with lower case letters separated by periods. (e.g. <em>exempli gratia</em> would be written “e.g.“)</li>
<li>If an acronym or abbreviation which ends with a period is at the end of the sentence, the final period of the acronym should be replaced by the punctuation of the sentence. (e.g. “Does the country have poor relations with the P.R.C?” would be a stylistically correct sentence.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ambiguous Definitions</h2>
<p>A number of words have multiple meanings. To avoid confusion, the following table standardizes the usage of words.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Word</th>
<th>Meaning and Usage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Country</td>
<td>A sovereign state recognized by the global state system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>State</td>
<td>To avoid confusion between American states and sovereign states, this term should generally be avoided.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Capitalization</h2>
<p>Capitalization should generally follow standard English capitalization rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first word in each sentence is capitalized.</li>
<li>Proper nouns are capitalized. Regular nouns are capitalized when used as a proper noun.</li>
<li>The pronoun ‘I’ is capitalized.</li>
<li>A title is capitalized only when used as part of a compound proper noun.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Countries</h2>
<p>The first reference to a country in any given post or tidbit must use its primary name. Further references to the country may choose between the primary name, the acronym, or the secondary name.</p>
<p><em>This list only references countries and proposed countries which have been mentioned on this blog. It will be updated as needed.</em></p>

<h2>Italics</h2>
<p>The following items should be italicized:</p>
<ul>
<li>The title of a book, movie, album, or other creative work </li>
<li>A thought</li>
<li>An untranslated phrase from another language, including phrases often used in English (e.g. <em>coup d’état</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Italics should be avoided in all other circumstances.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Links should include punctuation only if that punctuation is part of an acronym or abbreviation.</p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>When writing comma-separated lists, the serial comma appears prior to the word “and” or “or.” When writing semicolon-separated lists, a semicolon and the word “and” or “or” should precede the final entry.</p>
<h2>Names</h2>
<p>Any person mentioned in a post should initially be referred to by their full name and title(s). If their title is in a national government, the title should be preceded by the appropriate denonym (e.g. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney).
For second and later mentions, an honorific, such as “Ms.”, should precede a last name. If a person’s title may be used as an honorific in normal usage, it may also do so in a post.</p>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>Numbers zero through twenty should be spelled out. Numbers with a value of 21 or greater should be written with arabic numerals.</p>
<h2>Possession</h2>
<p>In singular words that end with the letter ‘s’, possession is indicated by appending the suffix “-’s”.</p>
<h2>Preferred Terms</h2>
<p>Some terms are preferred over others. This table lists terms which should be replaced by preferred terms.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Preferred Term</th>
<th>Other Terms</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>(the) First World War</td>
<td>WWI, World War One, the Great War</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(the) Second World War</td>
<td>WWII, World War Two</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Spelling</h2>
<p>When there is one standard American English spelling for a word, it is used in this blog. When a word’s spelling is ambiguous, the spellings in this section are used.</p>

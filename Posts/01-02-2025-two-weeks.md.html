<h1>Two Weeks</h1>
<p>The past two weeks have been... interesting.</p>
<p>I don’t mean interesting in the sense that “oh, everything is fine, dandy, and really grabs my attention.” I mean interesting in the sense that “better pay attention ‘cause the world sure doesn’t look like it’s in a great place.”</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, President Trump returned to office. Since that day, his administration has committed to a wide variety of divisive and destructive decisions. I am of the opinion that the actions Mr. Trump has taken so far undermine our <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-duties-to-address-the-flow-of-illicit-drugs-across-our-national-border/">economy</a>, our <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reinstating-service-members-discharged-under-the-militarys-covid-19-vaccination-mandate/">military</a>, our <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/">democratic values</a>, and the future of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/">global climate</a>.</p>
<p>While I disapprove of these actions, I am far more concerned about the ways in which the Trump Administration is systematically dehumanizing people who live in our country. Mass deportations of immigrants don’t just <a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/immigrants-to-the-u-s-create-more-jobs-than-they-take">undermine our economy</a>; they ruin people’s lives. Immigration agents carrying out arrests have allegedly arrested people, including natural born American citizens, based on the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-immigration-raids-citizens-profiling-accusations-native-american-rcna189203">color of their skin</a>.</p>
<p>Immigrants are not alone in being singled out by the Trump Administration. The transgender community, to which I belong, has been repeatedly targeted in the past two weeks. Not only have we been <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/">banned from serving our country</a> in the armed forces, but the executive order doing so referred to us as unable to live an “honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle,” and declared us “mentally and physically [un]fit for duty.”</p>
<p>Unsatisfied with simply denying transgender Americans the opportunity to serve their country, Mr. Trump’s administration has targeted the youngest members of our community. He has signed executive orders cutting off <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/">access to healthcare</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/">cracking down</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition#Social,_psychological,_and_aesthetic_aspects">social transition</a> in schools, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/">repealed</a> legal protections for our community.</p>
<p>Now, I realize you, dear reader, might have questions about the transgender community. That’s perfectly understandable. But the actions currently being taken by the Trump Administration don’t seem particularly interested in asking questions. Instead, they seem calculated to erase transgender people from public life, as <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924/">promised by Michael Knowles</a> two years ago at CPAC.</p>
<p>These attacks on immigrants and the transgender community compose a vividly disturbing picture: a presidential administration which sees ordinary Americans as less than human. I know the effects of the actions taken by this administration have affected me personally. Over the past two weeks I’ve struggled to go through the motions of everyday life. For the last few days I’ve felt as though I was in a dark pit with no way out. Everything felt gray, bland, and dark. Maybe you’ve felt this way, too.</p>
<p>After three particularly difficult days, I decided continuing that way was untenable. I needed to channel my angst into something substantial. That something substantial is this blog. Unlike traditional blogs, I’m creating this blog for myself. It’s still accessible to the public, of course, but my primary audience is my own well being. Although I anticipate writing primarily about politics, it’s likely I’ll also touch on many other topics which interest me. Expect pieces on linguistics, economics, and computer science. I might also write about my personal life and publish both literary and visual art I create.</p>
<p>You’ll probably disagree with me sometimes. That’s okay. People <em>should</em> disagree with one another. But also, this website is for me. You’re welcome to come and take a look to see what I’m up to, and I look forward to your thoughtful comments and criticisms. I fervently believe that a core component of a healthy democracy is a healthy political discourse, and I welcome your feedback. Ultimately, however, I’ll publish what I want to publish.</p>
<p>At the college I attend, students spray paint a rock in the center of campus with messages. The current message? “America is bleeding.” If our beautiful country is bleeding, I think the best way to stifle the bleeding is by sharing.</p>                <div class = "bottomText">

<h4 class="postInfo">Published March 22, 2025</h4>
</div>
<p>Ten years ago, American President Donald Trump descended an escalator and began his first campaign for President. Since that day, his rhetoric and policies have dramatically changed the American Overton Window – the range of what is politically acceptable. But Mr. Trump hasn’t merely shifted the Overton Window; he has dramatically degraded the quality of discourse and the standards by which Americans judge their political leaders.</p>
<p>That’s because Mr. Trump is corrosive.</p>
<p>In the ten years since he descended that escalator, Mr. Trump has corroded political and social norms, eroded institutions, and trampled on the rule of law. He has singlehandedly, systematically dismantled nearly a quarter millennium of American democratic cultural traditions. Our politics have gone from being merely divisive to being a zero-sum game in which even an iota of bipartisanship is seen as betrayal.</p>
<p>During Mr. Trump’s first term in office, the news cycle was driven by the outrageous things he proclaimed. The erraticism and chaos associated with Mr. Trump were notorious, but the damage he did was caused primarily by his words, rather than his policies. Mr. Trump was first impeached after he <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50886437">verbally blackmailed</a> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He was impeached the second time when he verbally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">encouraged a mob</a> to storm the U.S. Capitol Building and overturn his election loss. It was spur-of-the-moment verbal order by Mr. Trump that led to the infamous <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/6/11/22527796/ig-report-trump-bible-lafayette-square-protest">dispersion of protesters</a> in Lafayette Square.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric, his administration achieved policy victories well within the G.O.P. mainstream: the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the renegotiation of international mail, the Abraham Accords, the NAFTA renegotiation, and Operation Warp Speed all come to mind. On the international stage, Mr. Trump’s erratic and bombastic style even proved useful; White House aides were able to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/opinion/trump-universal-postal-union.html">present themselves</a> as beleaguered yet helpful allies working for a mercurial boss.</p>
<p>In the few places where Mr. Trump violated G.O.P. opinion, such as with family separation at the border, he backtracked. Although he was to the right of the Party, the Party constrained him. One of the great shifts in Mr. Trump’s second term is that the Republican Party can no longer fulfill that task.</p>
<p>Starting in 2015, Mr. Trump systematically corroded the Republican Party. For years, Mr. Trump called out the Republican politicians who were most strident in their opposition to him, catalyzing their own constituents to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/rep-liz-cheney-loses-primary-wyoming-trump-backed-challenger-rcna43379">primary them</a> out of elected office.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump exerted his corrosive influence over the G.O.P. even while he was out of office. Mr. Trump’s Big Lie about the 2020 election results, his claim that the January 6 rioters working to overturn the results of the election were patriots, his increasingly <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-liz-cheney-rifle-guns-tucker-carlson-b2639521.html">violent rhetoric</a>, all became litmus tests for his fellow party members. One could loudly support Mr. Trump, choose not to say anything, or speak out. That latter group was small, and its members: Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, among others, are now by and large out of office.</p>
<p>With a few <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5187685-trump-threatens-massie-re-election/">exceptions</a>, Mr. Trump is no longer calling out Republican politicians for being insufficiently loyal. That’s not because he’s changed, but because the Party has. There is no longer space in the Republican Party to publicly oppose Mr. Trump’s policies.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump hasn’t only corroded our politics; he hasn’t only corroded the Republican Party, he has corroded <em>himself</em>.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with yes-men who don’t merely comply to his demands unthinkingly; his administration escalates and intensifies his whims into <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/">substantive policy</a>. As Mr. Trump and his administration shift the Overton Window, Mr. Trump remains eternally on the Window’s rightmost flank. There is no end to Mr. Trump’s revanchist vision for the United States; merely an intensification of the reactionary policies he has already espoused.</p>
<p>Shortly after he was elected, political commentators rushed to discuss what Mr. Trump might do. For many, a consensus emerged: he would <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-weekend/watch/-donald-trump-is-all-talk-harris-campaign-manager-points-out-the-contrasts-on-immigration-policy-220361285614">say a lot of uncouth things</a>, but, like his first term, he would ultimately prove incapable of doing much permanent damage.</p>
<p>Boy were they wrong.</p>
<p>In the weeks since he took office, Mr. Trump has dramatically weakened his country’s position on the world stage. The collapse of <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5310673/usaid-trump-administration-global-health">U.S.A.I.D.</a>, the elimination of research grants, the end of <a href="https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/03/16/end-of-era-as-trump-administration-guts-radio-free-europe-and-voa-en-news">R.F.E./R.L.</a>, and since rescinded plans to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5303947/hegseth-trump-defense-spending-cuts">reduce military spending</a> are all indicative of a United States which is turning inwards.</p>
<p>While Mr. Trump’s work signals that the United States is a less reliable international partner, his transformation of the United States’ internal politics is perhaps even more dramatic. Through <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-calls-opponents-jailed-dark-212235567.html">threats</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/21/paul-weiss-law-firm-trump-executive-order/82589374007/">legal actions</a>, and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/10/trump-undocumented-immigrants-crackdown-columbia-00222245">incarceration and deportation</a> of those who criticize him, he has caused self-censorship to spread across the nation. Many major media outlets are hurriedly instituting new norms intended to make the criticism of Mr. Trump’s administration more difficult. When Mr. Trump brings frivolous libel lawsuits against legacy media outlets, they now often choose simply <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5288181/why-cbs-stands-at-the-epicenter-of-trumps-assault-on-the-media">to settle</a>. Those who would once have been perfectly happy to be quoted criticizing Mr. Trump ask to be left anonymous, fearing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-democracy.html">retribution</a>. Lawyers and law firms are intimidated by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/">federal policy</a>. Immigrants whose political speech is seen as inconvenient face deportation, sometimes to prison camps in <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-wants-to-hold-up-to-30000-detained-migrants-at-guantanamo-bay-heres-what-to-know">Guantanamo Bay</a> or <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/22/cecot-trump-el-salvador-prison-deportation-video/82596983007/">El Salvador</a>.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the United States Congress, dysfunctional for years, has been unable to check Mr. Trump as he dismantles Congressionally-created agencies and tramples on the rule of law. But it is disturbing, if not surprising, that Mr. Trump has apparently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-venezuela-el-salvador-immigration-dd4f61999f85c4dd8bcaba7d4fc7c9af">defied a court order</a> so early in his term. As I wrote before, Mr. Trump corrodes the standards of our discourse. Right now, it is seen as anomalous that Mr. Trump’s administration defied a court order; if the administration makes a regular habit of it, however, it will quickly become seen as the new normal.</p>
<p>Democracies don’t become autocracies overnight. They experience a shift of norms and of discourse. A corrosion, if you will. In the United States, it is becoming increasingly apparent that Mr. Trump is that corrosion.</p>
<p>The question is no longer: “Will President Trump try to criminalize speech he doesn’t like?” He’s already done that. The question is no longer “Will President Trump make the media give him more flattering coverage?” He’s already done that. The question is no longer “Will President Trump defy the courts?” He’s already done that. The question is: “Will anyone do anything about it?”</p>

<h3>People Thought the F-35 Looked Bad, But it was Just Being Stealthy</h3>
<p>The F-35 has long been derided by observers of the military-industrial complex. Construction, maintenance, and flight costs were alleged to be too high, even as the aircraft has proved itself vastly superior to its competition.</p>
<p>As F-35 production and use have ramped up, not only have real costs come down, but <a href="https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/03/the-f-35-fighter-question-that-lingers-year-after-year/">nominal prices have</a>, too. Although the trends are not guaranteed to hold, the F-35 is looking like a better and better investment as Lockheed Martin’s economies of scale increase.</p>
<p>But those economies of scale may halt in the near future. U.S. allies are considering the cancellation of their F-35 orders as the U.S. erraticism grows under President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, who has threatened key American allies with not only tariffs, but actual invasion, is fundamentally destabilizing American alliances around the world. One of the many side-effects of his actions may be a reduction of F-35 production and resultantly higher prices.</p>
<div class="space"></div>
<h3>Israel, Hamas Resume Fighting</h3>
<p>In a turn that will probably surprise nobody, Israel and Hamas have resumed fighting one another. Ever since the first phase of the ceasefire ended without a second phase being agreed on, it’s felt like it was just a matter of time until one side or the other restarted hostilities.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday morning, Israel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-airstrikes.html">carried out major attacks</a> in the Gaza Strip. This isn’t the first time Israel has attacked Hamas since the initial phase of the ceasefire began, but it is clearly an escalation, and one that likely indicates that fighting will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I feel a deep sense of tragedy looking at the conflict. This endless cycle of violence isn’t going to resolve itself, but neither Israel nor Hamas is willing to yield on their priorities. Looking at the declared goals of each side, I can’t help but think that the current bout of violence is unusually zero-sum, even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p>In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likely believes that he will lose reelection and finally go to prison on corruption charges when the war ends. In Gaza, Hamas officials likely believe that they may very well be forced out of power when the war ends, their organization severely weakened. I think don’t think that the leadership on either side of the conflict is personally interested in peace. And if the only people who  can achieve peace are unwilling to try, we’re just not going to see peace achieved.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m wrong about either the Israeli or the Gazan leadership. Maybe leadership on one side (or both) is willing to put their civilian population before their personal interests. But even if I’m wrong, as long as the non-negotiable items on the table really are non-negotiable, then Israel and Hamas will not get far with their diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>War happens when two groups cannot resolve an issue through diplomacy and resort to using force in order to achieve their will. Eventually, one side or both sides decide to settle their interests at a table, with the relative gains and losses from the war shaping who gets what. Right now, it’s not really clear to me that either Israel or Hamas has emerged as a clear winner: as I wrote back in February, they’re playing <a href="https://hansonbrook.com/Posts/2025-02-08-between-the-river-and-the-ceasefire.html">very different games</a>. Israel is trying to fight a conventional war, while Hamas is waging what is effectively a public relations campaign. They’re both winning at their goals.</p>
<p>Winning sides don’t make many concessions.</p>
<div class="space"></div>
<h3>Radio Free America</h3>
<p>During the height of the Cold War, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty worked to provide accurate news coverage to countries under the shadow of the Iron Curtain. Although the organizations were created to advance American political interests, they became more than that. Staffed by dissidents who had fled the Eastern Bloc, the organizations effectively served as a free press for people who weren’t free.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union and the democratization of much of Europe, the organizations were merged together. The combined organization, R.F.E./R.L., which continues to be funded by the United States Congress, works to provide an unbiased, trustworthy newssource to people suffering under the stifling blanket of autocracy the world over. Today, <a href="https://about.rferl.org/about-rfe-rl/">according to the organization</a>, it provides a free press service to nearly 50 million people every week. It has defied totalitarian regimes <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/Czech_Intelligence_Reveals_Iraqi_Plot_To_Attack_RFERL/1891512.html">at great risk</a> to its remarkably brave and dedicated staff.</p>
<p>Authoritarians from around the world have fought to be rid of R.F.E./R.L. for decades. On Saturday, the Trump Administration gave them their wish, and <a href="https://about.rferl.org/article/rfe-rl-president-defunding-would-be-massive-gift-to-americas-enemies/">cancelled</a> the organization’s funding.</p>
<div class="space"></div>
<h3>Bad Day for Eastern European Leaders Who Hate Protests</h3>
<p>Two different Eastern European leaders saw mass protests calling for their resignations yesterday: <a href="https://www.diepresse.com/19474914/viktor-orban-ausgepfiffen-massen-bei-protest-in-budapest">Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/world/europe/serbia-protest-president-vucic.html">Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić</a>. The demonstration in Belgrade likely saw somewhere between 100,000 and one million protesters. The protest in Budapest saw <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/hungary-magyar-orban-protests/33349014.html">at least</a> 50,000.</p>
<p>While it is unlikely that either leader will step down before their next election, it is astounding to see this kind of popular protest against authoritarian leaders materializing in countries which had heretofore been far more tolerant of them.</p>
<p>In my ideal world, these protests would foretell a coming decline in global authoritarian sentiment. In reality, they will almost certainly prove little more than a blip in global media coverage.</p>

<h1 class="bigLink"><a href="../Posts/2025-03-15-whither-kurdistan.html">Whither Kurdistan</a></h1>
<h4 class="postInfo">Published March 15, 2025</h4>
</div>
<p>A few weeks ago, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkmg3kmmero">ceasefire</a> between the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (P.K.K.) terrorist organization and the Republic of Türkiye was achieved. Then, just this week, another <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/10/syria-merges-kurdish-led-syrian-democratic-forces-into-state-institutions">announcement</a> was made:  the Syrian Democratic Forces (S.D.F.), a Kurdish military faction, will join the new Syrian government. Between these two announcements, the possibility of an independent Kurdish state has become even more of an open question.</p>
<p>The ceasefire between Türkiye and the P.K.K. occurred after imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan called for the organization to disband itself. The ceasefire is almost certainly a setback for Kurdish national aspirations and a victory for Türkiye. A Kurdish state would almost certainly incorporate land currently within the borders of Türkiye, an obviously unacceptable proposition for nationalist Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Over the past several decades, the country has opposed the Kurdish independence movement in rhetoric and military action, both within its own borders and along its border with Syria.</p>
<p>The effect of the S.D.F.’s incorporation into the new Syrian government, on the other hand, is more complicated and more difficult to predict. Yet regardless of the results of the incorporation of the S.D.F., the broader Kurdish independence movement is unlikely to collapse. The movement, which is <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/kurds-long-struggle-statelessness">more than 100 years old</a>, consists of multiple loosely affiliated organizations in several predominantly post-Ottoman countries.</p>
<p>That’s not a typo: the independence movement is really 100 years old.</p>
<h2>A 100 Year Movement</h2>
<p>In 1918, the Peace of Paris ended the First World War and radically changed the world order. The peace process is infamous for its many failures, one of which was the creation of the League of Nations, the predecessor to the U.N. Although the League is best known for its ineffectual nature, it also played a major role in managing the Ottoman Empire’s ruinous dissolution.</p>
<p>The League of Nations put much of the former Ottoman Empire into Class A Mandates, as part of its infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate">Mandate System</a>. The Class A Mandates were nominally intended to provide support for territories as an interstitial step between being members of the Ottoman Empire and achieving full statehood. This didn’t exactly pan out for... a whole bunch of reasons. (Given that the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/law-and-practice-of-international-territorial-administration/mandate-system-of-the-league-of-nations/1D6E45373D241F153CA50E55BE69638D">language</a> the League used to justify the Mandate System is reminiscent of Ruyard Kipling’s “The White Man’s Burden” poem, it’s just ever-so-possible that colonialism may have played a role.)</p>
<p>In the specific case of Kurdish independence, however, the big issue was not with the Mandates themselves, but with how they were instituted. The League failed to fully think through the national identities of the people living in the newly divided territories. The Kurdish people, a major ethnic group in the region, were resultantly split across the Syrian and Iraqi mandates, as well as the newly formed country of Turkey (now Türkiye), all of which had formerly been part of the Ottoman Empire. Without land designated for them to one day call their own, a Kurdish independence movement began to develop.</p>
<p>The movement quickly developed a poor track record of negotiating with surrounding countries, so it is unsurprising that it soon turned to warfare to achieve its goals. Rather than fighting with conventional means, many organizations supporting Kurdish independence resorted to guerrilla attacks launched from mountainous terrain. These organizations were resultingly (and accurately) branded as terroristic. Yet it seems improbable that the movement, which has been enormously successful at taking on far larger, conventional military forces, would have been able to survive without such practices.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is unsurprising that both violent and nonviolent parts of the Kurdish independence movement have catalyzed harsh reactions from countries with large Kurdish populations. What is concerning, however, is that these reactions rarely target militants alone. In Syria, many Kurdish people were stripped of their citizenship and rendered stateless. Perhaps most notoriously, the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein oversaw the Anfal Campaign, which saw the poison gas and other chemical weapons deployed against Kurdish population centers. Human rights organizations have since <a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/">copiously documented</a> the Anfal Campaign and designated it a genocide.</p>
<p>The Kurdish independence movement has not yet achieved its aspirations. But despite decades of oppression, Kurdish nationalism is still thriving. This enduring national sentiment has been to the chagrin of regional political leaders, and although Mr. Hussein is an outlier in the extremity of his approach to Kurdish people, he is not alone in repressing them.</p>
<h2>Fall of the P.K.K.</h2>
<p>Under President Erdogan, Türkiye has worked to <em>de facto</em> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turkey-country-policy-and-information-notes/country-policy-and-information-note-peoples-democratic-party-hdp-october-2023-accessible--2">criminalize</a> expressions of Kurdish nationalism. The Turkish government works to associate peaceful protesters expressing support for Kurdish rights with the militant P.K.K., and subsequently arrests them.</p>
<p>With the Turkish-P.K.K. ceasefire, Türkiye may be deprived of a useful organization to associate peaceful Kurdish separatists with in order to delegitamize them. On the other hand, the increased domestic security is probably a worthwhile tradeoff in the eyes of President Erdogan.</p>
<p>The long-term impact for Türkiye’s domestic Kurdish population is not completely clear. Without the P.K.K. to contend with, Mr. Erdogan’s government may turn its attention to other matters. On the other hand, it is possible that the ceasefire will prove ephemeral and that fighting will resume within a few months or years.</p>
<h2>Integration of the S.D.F.</h2>
<p>On the other hand, while Türkiye may have weakened its domestic Kurdish independence movement, the incorporation of the S.D.F. into the new Syrian government seems likely to strengthen Syria’s. It is a distinct possibility that the incorporation of the S.D.F. heralds a semi-autonomous Kurdish government being instituted in northern Syria, similar to the situation in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28147263">post-Hussein Iraq</a>. A semi-autonomous region could even lay the groundwork for the establishment of a fully sovereign Kurdish state.</p>
<p>This possibility, however, is not guaranteed to come to pass. A potential semi-autonomous zone would almost certainly be on the Turkish border, likely upsetting Ankara. And even if a semi-autonomous Kurdish-controlled region did develop, there’s no guarantee it would last. Similar semi-autonomous Kurdish regions have often collapsed quickly; there’s a very good chance that another attempt wouldn’t last more than a few years.</p>
<h2>Syrian Motivations</h2>
<p>It is interesting that the new Syrian government has chosen to integrate the S.D.F., in both civil and military regards. My suspicion is that there are three key reasons which drove this decision.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the Syrian government is probably aiming to reduce the number of remaining factions in the country now that Mr. Assad has been removed from power. If all of, or most of, the anti-Assad rebel groups are able to work together, Syria has a real shot at achieving peace after a decade of war.</p>
<p>Second, the S.D.F. controls many of Syria’s <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/sdf-kurds-deal-syria/#:~:text=New%20leadership%20brings%20SDF%20into,syria">oil and gas fields</a>; having access to the associated revenues and the broader economic benefits will seriously strengthen Syria’s new government’s economic legitimacy.</p>
<p>Third, the moves seem intended to project an image of the new government as pluralistic. The integration of the S.D.F. came shortly before a <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/middle-east/2025/03/12/syrias-interim-president-secures-agreement-with-druze-and-kurds/">similar deal</a> was made with the Druze ethnic minority group. Not only do these moves seem intended to convince those concerned that the new Islamic leadership will prove intolerant of other identities, but they seem almost aimed at one specific observer: Israel.</p>
<p>Israel has previously <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/official-israel-providing-aid-to-kurds-since-us-pullout-in-syria/">provided military support</a> to the S.D.F., and is a long-time supporter of the Kurdish independence movement. Similarly, the Druze minority community is small within Israel, but it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/world/middleeast/israel-druse-nation-state-law.html">politically significant</a>.</p>
<p>Israel has acted quite aggressively towards Syria since the fall of Mr. Assad’s regime. Since the Assad regime fell, Israel has captured land in the Golan Heights and bombed Syrian military facilities. If Syria is able to assuage Israeli fears, even while losing the remainder of the Golan Heights, it may ensure its new government can escape the wrath of its more powerful neighbor to the south.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>With the ceasefire between Türkiye and the P.K.K., and the integration of the S.D.F. into the new Syrian government, the future of Kurdistan as an independent state has rarely been dimmer. But on the flip side, a peaceful semi-autonomous Kurdish region in Syria is at least imaginable. Kurdistan may not be in the cards for the next decade or two, but perhaps everyday Kurdish people have a chance to reap at least some of the benefits of autonomy, even if it seems unlikely to be the full thing.</p>

<h3>Fun with Funding the Government</h3>
<p>The New York Times is reporting that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/government-shutdown-senate-democrats.html?smid=url-share">backing</a> the passage of the continuing resolution to fund the government. Mr. Schumer asserts that if the bill is not passed, President Trump will be able to further centralize power around himself.</p>
<p>I think that Mr. Schumer’s instincts are correct. Given the speed with which the Trump Administration has radically transformed the government, it seems likely that a shutdown could be used as a pretense to fire more civil servants and further centralize power around Mr. Trump. In fact, if there were a shutdown, it is plausible that rather than sending people home from work for a few days or weeks, the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” would simply terminate their employment.</p>
<p>While the continuing resolution does <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/11/congress/house-republicans-move-to-block-vote-on-trumps-tariffs-00223947">reduce congressional ability</a> to check the executive branch, electoral politics also matter. Although a display of bipartisanship may not increase support for the Democrats, filibustering the continuing resolution would surely feature in future Republican campaign ads. The Party has axiomatically committed itself to making government work; this is one of the times when it needs to do so.</p>
<div class="space"></div>
<h3>Phase Two Ceasefire Struggles</h3>
<p>It seems utterly unsurprising that Israel and Hamas are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-trump-ukraine.html">struggling</a> to come to a deal on the second phase of the ceasefire. Each side in the negotiations has fundamentally incompatible demands; although war is not beneficial to the aims of either Israel or Hamas (hence the continuing ceasefire), neither side has been put in a position where it needs to concede core negotiation points.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there aren’t compelling humanitarian reasons to want an end to the war. Israel’s twelve-day total blockade of Gaza, designed to put pressure on Hamas, is more likely to <a href="https://aje.io/ejvazw?update=3577032">harm civilians</a> than combatants.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, it seems unlikely that the negotiations in Qatar are going to yield results in the short term; despite an exchange of prisoners and hostages, the Israel-Hamas relation remains almost an entirely zero-sum game. From a realist perspective, this failure of negotiation is nothing if not expected. From a humanitarian perspective, though, it’s a tragedy.</p>

<h3>March 12, 2020</h3>
<p>Five years ago today, on March 12, 2020, my world changed.</p>
<p>At the time, I was living in Nuremberg, Germany, as an exchange student on a Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange scholarship. My year had proven wonderful: I had an amazing host family and attended a wonderful school. There are so many things I think about when that year comes to mind, but that very unique week in early March will be forever seared into my mind.</p>
<p>A then-novel coronavirus had arrived in Italy several weeks before. Since then, it had begun spreading inside Germany. Each day, the number of patients and the number of countries impacted seemed to grow.</p>
<p>That Tuesday, March 10, after much analysis of the rapidly changing situation, the State Department informed members of my exchange program that we would remain in Germany despite the rapidly growing outbreak. On Thursday morning, I learned that the Trump Administration had increased the relative risk level of traveling to Europe. Around noon, members of my exchange program received notice that we should pack our bags and prepare to return home in the next 24-72 hours.</p>
<p>Those last few days in Germany were unforgettable. On Friday, my head felt warm, my limbs ached, and I wondered if I had a fever. Did I have it? I decided it was probably just a stress reaction. I remember meeting up with friends for drinking chocolate, my host mother purchasing a monster pretzel for my last breakfast in Nuremberg, saying goodbye to my classmates (and taking a group photo).</p>
<p>At 3:00 A.M. on Sunday, March 15, 2020, my host mother and I took a taxi to the airport. I flew to Frankfurt, joined other members of my exchange program, and then proceeded onwards to Newark on a 787. Most of the seats on the flight were empty; people started just sitting wherever they wanted to. It was as if the world was ending. It was definitely changing; I don’t think I’ve flown on a plane where no one masked ever since. (At the time, masks were scarce and being rationed for medical workers and people with suspected symptoms.)</p>
<p>By the time I landed later that day, the United States was in the process of shutting down. At the airport, we filled out forms about our recent medical history and walked through a line surrounded by C.D.C. people in white scrubs. They checked each person’s temperature as we walked into the customs room. Because I had had symptoms a few days before, I was taken aside and given a mask, before walking through an empty customs line with no one in front of me and no one behind me.</p>
<p>Those days are both unfathomable and unforgettable. In a matter of weeks, the world went from not knowing COVID-19 existed to completely shutting down. Despite the way those days are seared into my memory, they feel surreal, as if they happened to someone else. I watched as the world changed, and yet now I cannot image so dramatic a transformation ever occuring again.</p>
<div class="space"></div>
<h3>Leadership Change in Canada</h3>
<p>Mark Carney will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/09/world/canada/mark-carney-liberal-election.html">become the next prime minister of Canada</a> later this week, after he was elected the leader of the country’s Liberal Party. Mr. Carney, who is expected to hold snap elections shortly after he becomes the Canadian premier, will replace the <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/justin-trudeau-steps-down-unpopular-13850591.html">remarkably unpopular</a> Justin Trudeau.</p>
<p>Mr. Carney’s foreign policy positions are not yet well delineated. His opposition to Brexit and plans to increase Canadian military spending to pass NATO’s <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-leadership-contender-mark-carney-defence-spending-1.7450718">two percent threshold</a> seem indicative of a liberal internationalist approach, but, because of his lack of previous foreign policy experience, it is difficult to be certain.</p>
<p>While Mr. Carney has previously expressed support for initiatives bringing the West together, he did make a number of  statements critical of American President Donald Trump while campaigning. While Mr. Carney’s comments were likely designed to consolidate political support, Mr. Trump may not see it that way. It seems plausible, in fact, that the mercurial Mr. Trump may intensify his attacks on Canada as as a response to perceived disrespect from Mr. Carney.</p>
<p>On domestic matters, Mr. Carney plans to scrap Canada’s <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-to-scrap-carbon-tax-1.7446908">carbon tax program</a> and replace it with a semi-protectionist tax on imports from climate-unfriendly countries. Much like leaders who have recently ascended to power in other Western nations, Mr. Carney has criticized immigration policy and called for a <a href="https://financialpost.com/news/economy/mark-carney-says-canadas-immigration-policy-suffered-failures-of-execution">reduction in immigration</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond his policies, Mr. Carney brings a remarkable degree of economic expertise to his new job. A graduate of Harvard and Oxford Universities, he is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mark-carney-crisis-fighting-central-banker-hopes-lead-canada-through-trade-war-2025-03-07/">the only person</a> to have headed the central bank of two separate G7 countries. Yet despite that expertise, his lack of experience as a politician, and with foreign affairs, may ultimately prove too great of a hindrance to overcome.</p>
<p>After Mr. Trudeau’s resignation, the Liberal Party has seen a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/11034743/liberals-lead-poll-federal-vote-feb-25/">significant surge</a> in the polls. If the shift in polling holds, the Liberal Party will win its next election; Mr. Carney may well be Canada’s prime minister for years to come.</p>

<div class="postInfo">
<h1 class="bigLink"><a href="../Posts/2025-03-08-belt-and-road.html">Belt and Road</a></h1>
<h4 class="postInfo">Published March 8, 2025</h4>
</div>
<p>In 2013, just a year after being selected to lead the People’s Republic of China, President Xi Jinping launched one of his signature policy maneuvers: the Belt and Road Initiative (B.R.I.). The Initiative invests in development through loans provided by state-owned Chinese banks. And these loans are big.</p>
<p>After running the Initiative for over a decade, the P.R.C. has made nearly $1 trillion of investments, primarily in developing countries. And it shows no signs of slowing down: in nominal terms, last year saw <a href="https://greenfdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nedopil-2025_China-Belt-and-Road-Initiative-BRI-Investment-Report-2024-1.pdf">the highest spending on B.R.I. projects</a> yet. Developments funded by the B.R.I. include mining infrastructure, manufacturing facilities, harbors, and even <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dech.12606">airports</a>.</p>
<p>Although the Initiative is framed as investing in those along historical trade routes, in practice, countries around the world participate in the initiative. And although the initiative is primarily aimed at lower and middle income countries, some of the more than 150 countries which are party to the Initiative are major players on the international stage: member states <a href="https://green-bri.org/countries-of-the-belt-and-road-initiative-bri/">include</a> Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Joining the B.R.I. is simple. States sign a memorandum of understanding with China. This memorandum is typically non-binding and simply signals a willingness to work together. The participating country and the P.R.C. might then sign binding secondary agreements for individual projects under the Initiative.</p>
<p>The World Bank has <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/regional-integration/brief/belt-and-road-initiative">estimated</a> that, because of Belt and Road:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Increased trade is expected to increase global real income by 0.7 to 2.9 percent, not including the cost of infrastructure investment.</em> The largest gains are expected for corridor economies, with real income gains between 1.2 and 3.4 percent. Increases in FDI would further boost these effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the World Bank is correct, the global economic gains provided by the B.R.I. are indisputably good. But although the Initiative may have global economic benefits, it hasn’t been nearly as much of a success story for China’s banks. The two primary lenders of capital for Belt and Road projects, the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/22/opinion/china-debt-belt-road.html">attempted to obscure</a> losses caused by failed loan repayment. Failure to repay has, in fact, become such a serious enough issue that China has resorted to increasingly coercive tactics to solicit repayment. Meanwhile, many of the infrastructure projects funded under the B.R.I. have been <a href="https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2024/02/27/tightening-the-belt-or-end-of-the-road-chinas-bri-at-10/">downright wasteful</a>, leaving China in the awkward situation of attempting to force repayments of loans used to build pointless and, at times, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-global-mega-projects-infrastructure-falling-apart-11674166180">shoddy</a> infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>So, if the world is economically benefiting from Belt and Road while Chinese banks suffer because of it, then why does China continue to fund it?</p>
<h2>Soft Power</h2>
<p>The most commonly cited benefit of the B.R.I. is soft power. By providing funding to countries around the world, the P.R.C. is able to present itself as a benevolent state ready to take up a dominant position in the rules-based international order. Especially because of the global proliferation of democracies, it is in China’s best interests to develop a popular image for itself in the global imagination.</p>
<p>If soft power is/was China’s goal with Belt and Road, it would be following in the footsteps of other major powers. Although China proved uninterested in joining the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSpecial%3ASearch%3Fsearch%3Dparis%2520club%26go%3DGo&amp;rut=71f7fb51d0c093590d33eb4477bf5cb7f6177a0b94b00bc5574db516d3babce6">Paris Club</a>, it is quite possible that the B.R.I. was conceived of as a way to gain the soft power traditionally associated with lending options.</p>
<p>But although soft power may have been high on China’s list of priorities when creating the B.R.I., it seems unlikely that it remains a goal. China’s recent efforts to recoup debts from states which have fallen behind on repayments, up to, and including, the seizure of property it has helped develop, seems likely to endanger whatever popular support it gained from its lending.</p>
<h2>Profit and Debt Trap Diplomacy</h2>
<p>It is also possible that the P.R.C. created Belt and Road in order to profit. Although its banks have suffered in the short term, Belt and Road projects typically use Chinese labor for their construction, meaning that China’s broader economy sees major benefits.</p>
<p>Some have gone further, arguing that China’s ability to seize projects which have not seen repayment means that it is able to build up a more global presence. Such critics point to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html">seizure of a port in Sri Lanka</a>. The port, which was leased to China for a length of 99 years after Sri Lanka was unable to repay its loans, is located just miles from a strategic waterway. Chinese control of the port could potentially strengthen China’s naval capabilities in the Indian Ocean. In fact, it already has: China has since <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/19/1118113095/sri-lanka-china-ship-hambantota-port">docked military vessels</a> in the port.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that there are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19480881.2023.2195280">no signs</a> that the P.R.C. is engaging in debt trap diplomacy. Nevertheless, there is little question that Chinese banks handing out Belt and Road loans have engaged in a number of <a href="https://thegeopolitics.com/the-complete-story-of-debt-trap-diplomacy/#google_vignette">problematic practices</a>. First, they have loaned more money to countries than those countries can comfortably commit to paying back. Second, B.R.I. loans tend to be at much higher interest rates than comparative loans from the World Bank or Paris Club lenders. Although the phrase “debt trap” may be stretching it, there is little question that banks implementing Belt and Road have engaged in potentially exploitative lending practices. Even though Belt and Road is a state initiative, the use of poorly regulated market-driven corporations to distribute funds sets it up to engage in problematic ways.</p>
<h2>Dependence</h2>
<p>It is also true that there is a certain degree of power inherent in funding other states. If a smaller, weaker state becomes accustomed to receiving funding, threats to cut off that source of support can be used as a means to complement the allure of funding. A world dominated by states dependent on China will naturally become more inclined to support the P.R.C. on matters of concern to it, thereby enabling it to exert greater influence on the international stage.</p>
<h2>Resource Extraction</h2>
<p>Still others claim that the purpose of the B.R.I. is to extract resources from developing countries. Those who claim that Belt and Road is about resource extraction argue that because China has enormous manufacturing capabilities, it is in its interest to gain access to raw material from developing countries in order to maximize its continued growth. Although this is an intriguing theory, I am ultimately skeptical of it. China has vast natural resources, and I’m not really sure that it needs to spend the equivalent of $1 trillion, much of it on transportation and manufacturing infrastructure, to access developing countries’ natural resources.</p>
<h2>The Raison d’Être of the Belt and Road</h2>
<p>Since B.R.I. hasn’t proven terribly profitable for Chinese banks, and given President Xi’s project of restructuring the rules-based international order, the Belt and Road Initiative seems like it should be destined to raise China’s national image. Yet high profile repayment struggles and exploitative lending practices would seem to put that assumption in question.</p>
<p>But maybe the exploitative lending practices and repayment struggles don’t really matter. Maybe the target audience for China’s soft power isn’t the world writ large. Because China’s lending practices are quite obscure, Belt and Road funds have been <a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/bri-corruption-magnet">embezzled by corrupt local officials</a>. Although China cracked down on corruption last year, it focused on <a href="https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/china-cracks-down-on-corruption-in-the-belt-and-road-program">Chinese government officials</a> who embezzled B.R.I. funds, rather than foreign politicians and bureaucrats. China doesn’t need to convince the masses that the Belt and Road is good for their countries. If it can convince corrupt officials that it’s good for their pockets, they’ll be perfectly willing to advance Chinese interests on the international stage every once-in-a-while.</p>
<p>If this frame of analysis is correct, then China is building soft power and dependency not for entire countries, but for specific foreign officials. Given that China favors a particularly soft approach on the global stage, <a href="https://journals.law.harvard.edu/ilj/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/BRI-Non-interference-and-Democracy-Ginsburg.pdf">proffering “win-win” scenarios</a> as its preference for international relations, this maneuver would fit into the broader Chinese approach to foreign policy. While I recognize that a leader-based approach does not fit into an international relations framework dependent on states as the dominant unit of analysis, I also do not think this possibility should be dismissed out of hand. Having national leaders who are personally beholden to the P.R.C. is just as effective, if not more effective, than national populations who see China as a positive force in the world.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>There is little question that the Belt and Road Initiative has had enormous positive impacts on the global economy. The problem with the B.R.I. is not that it aids development, but that its final cause remains unknown. Although it may exist solely to build traditional soft power or to generate profit, it seems indubitable that the Belt and Road Initiative exists to advance the P.R.C.’s national interests. Given the country’s continued interest in financing the B.R.I., it seems almost certain that the Initiative is succeeding on whatever metric of success China is using to measure it.</p>
<p>States work to maximize their own self interests. Belt and Road is almost certainly an enormous investment in China’s future as a wealthier, more powerful, and more globally involved state.</p>

<h3>A Changed Alliance</h3>
<p>A few days after American President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://hansonbrook.com/Posts/2025-03-01-a-catastrophic-meeting">truly horrendous meeting</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week, Mr. Trump cut Ukraine off from American aid and intelligence. On Thursday, the same day as a major European Union summit, he again threatened <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/world/europe/europe-self-defense-trump.html">to leave defenseless</a> NATO members who fail to spend two percent of their G.D.P. on security. In light of the seemingly seismic shift in American foreign policy, the international order is rapidly working to adapt.</p>
<p>In Europe, NATO has been reorganizing and restrategizing in the face of a United States apparently disinterested in following through on its preexisting international agreements. French President Emmanuel Macron has messaged that France will follow through on its Article Five commitments as a NATO member, up to, and including, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-hits-back-russian-fury-says-kremlin-feels-exposed-2025-03-06/">the use of nuclear weapons</a>. His likely soon-to-be German counterpart Friedrich Merz proposed spending €1 trillion on military and infrastructure. Some analysts believe that as Europe builds up its own security infrastructure, it may increasingly act <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/nato-ukraine-survive-without-united-states-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html">in its own interests</a> rather than those of the entire Western alliance.</p>
<p>One of my colleagues has suggested to me that decreasing commitments in Europe could be a good policy for the United States. According to this train of thought, reducing presence in Europe may be a necessary step in achieving a pivot towards Asia to balance the People’s Republic of China. Such a maneuver, however, does not appear to be the plan of the Trump Administration. Trump’s isolationist approach seems more reminiscent of a retreat back to “Fortress America” than a redirection of American resources to respond to new challenges.</p>
<p>Regardless of Mr. Trump’s intentions, it seems almost indubitable that Europe will become more unified, more self-sufficient, and more militarily capable. While I suspect that the long term consequences of Mr. Trump’s rearrangement of the international order will be bad for the United States, I suspect that it might actually prove quite beneficial for Europe as a geopolitical player.</p>

<h4 class="postInfo">Published March 7, 2025</h4>
</div>
<p>Building one’s own website is far more simple than one might expect. It’s also far more complicated.</p>
<p>Programming a website is simple. If you make a mistake with H.T.M.L. or C.S.S., they’ll fail softly: your website will look slightly wrong, but it will still load with no problem. Because I generate much of my HTML with a custom Python script I threw together, adjustments to my design easily propagate across my website.</p>
<p>On the flip side, perfecting the design of a website takes far more effort than you might expect. Every letter has to be carefully weighed, each ornament fully considered. Because my Python script recreates my entire website every time it runs, my design has to be thought out enough to work with content I have not yet created.</p>
<p>When I created this website, I thought the design would be a small weekend project. Instead, I’ve spent copious amounts of time researching independent website design in order to perfect this site. Resources like <a href="https://32bit.cafe/websiteideas/">32-Bit Cafe</a> and <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas">James’ Coffee Blog</a> have been invaluable in inspiring me to improve by blog. Developing a design which is accessible, modern, and distinctive is a serious task.</p>
<p>Each detail potentially impacts its fellows. Every change in layout makes some things look better and others worse. Although I originally used a Google Font to power this website’s typography, I ended up eliminating it in order to increase load times and protect user privacy. Now, pages load instantaneously, but they look slightly different on different computing platforms. It’s a small trade-off, but it’s probably for the best.</p>
<p>In addition to the visual improvements, there are many invisible changes also going on underneath the surface. Over the past few weeks, I’ve added appropriate meta tags to my pages; created an R.S.S. feed, and added structured data. All of these changes were implemented with no visible change to the user experience. Visually, I’ve made some adjustments as well. In addition to fixing some HTML bugs from my initial website design session, I added support for dark mode at the request of one of my readers.</p>
<p>But designing a blog isn’t only about the programming that goes into it. After all, there’s little point to having a blog if you don’t ever write anything. That’s where things get really interesting.</p>
<p>After several weeks of putting out a single long article each week, I decided to try something new this week; I put out smaller posts about once a day. Although I originally intended to link to individual articles elsewhere on the Internet, in the classic style of a link blog, my format seems to have evolved into a series of mini-essays. I’m not entirely sure how these short articles will continue to develop (or if they will at all), but I’ve surprised myself with how much more I’ve written in this space.</p>
<p>Not only have I been posting more, but I now have actual, real-life, people who – get this – read my blog. If you’ve been following my blog for the past month, you know that I didn’t create this blog in order to syndicate my ideas across the Internet; I created it so that I would have <a href="https://hansonbrook.com/Posts/2025-02-02-two-weeks.html">an emotional and creative outlet</a>. Although my readership is minuscule compared to the number of people on the web, knowing that even a handful of people care enough to read my blog and write me feedback means the world to me.</p>
<p>I could not be more pleased with the direction I have taken over the past month. With visual and under-the-hood improvements, with an increased cadence of publication, and with a small number of regular readers, I have surpassed my expectations for this place. In embarking on this experiment, I have discovered that writing about the news isn’t just cathartic; it strengthens my analyses and makes me a more capable thinker.</p>
<p>There are plenty of additional tasks for me to take on, of course. I want my website to have a slightly more distinctive personality, for example. I’m also concerned that the front page (which I’ve been calling “The Feed“) is not accessible enough. These are goals I plan to take on in my free time over the next few weeks; in just over a week, I have a break from classes and will be able to commit more time to both research and my various projects.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this first month of writing and managing a blog has been a delight. Talking about what I’m writing about has been an exciting new experience, and I’ve been developing a wonderful habit of writing out my thoughts. I’ve become more reflective, and, I suspect, a better communicator. Thank you for the warm support and thoughts you all send my way.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-democracy.html">Self-Censorship is Where Autocracy Begins</a></h3>
<p>Elisabeth Bumiller reports for The New York Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fired federal workers who are worried about losing their homes ask not to be quoted by name. University presidents fearing that millions of dollars in federal funding could disappear are holding their fire. Chief executives alarmed by tariffs that could hurt their businesses are on mute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, the Trump Administration is showing us exactly why the First Amendment exists. I would say that “democracy dies in darkness,” but the Washington Post has exemplified exactly the sort of cowardice that this article identifies. Because of Hayekian limitations, censorship is only effective when a critical mass of people censor themselves.</p>

<h3><a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-global-sea-ice-cover-record-low-and-third-warmest-february-globally">Record Low Sea Ice</a></h3>
<p>Like the opening montage of a bad science fiction film, each new scene in the climate change saga seems worse than the last. The European Union’s Copernicus Programme reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daily global sea ice extent, which combines the sea ice extents in both polar regions, reached a new all-time minimum in early February and remained below the previous record of February 2023 for the rest of the month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite repeated efforts to curb the effects of climate change, the anomalous worsening observed over the past several years seems to indicate we haven’t done enough. Despite the nearly thirty COPs which have been held over the past several decades, and despite progress made at Cairo and Paris, humanity seems stuck on the “business as usual” path.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera reports on the details of Egypt’s plan to redevelop Gaza, which was adopted yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first stage would last about six months, while the next two phases would take place over a combined four to five years... Once the roads are clear, 200,000 temporary housing units would be built to accommodate 1.2 million people and about 60,000 damaged buildings restored.</p>

<p>Between American President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu, rebuilding Gaza in an internationally acceptable way was always going to be a difficult task.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s proposal to redevelop the Gaza Strip as a “Riviera of the Middle East” by kicking all the residents out is an obvious non-starter. In contrast, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi’s $53 billion reconstruction plan seemed downright reasonable, and practically destined to garner regional support.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-04-2025-35f1959c28ad3c57a209f5464f2b5411">adoption of the plan</a> by Arab League countries is an obvious win for President Sisi, but he isn’t out of the woods yet. Even as Mr. Sisi has consolidated support in the Arab World, its relationship with Israel is suffering.</p>
<p>Mr. Sisi has deployed troops to the Sinai Penninusla, and although both Israel and Egypt deny that they intend declare war, there is almost endless (and, in my analysis, rather ridiculous) <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/middleeast/israel-egypt-war-gaza-intl/index.html">media speculation</a> about the possibility. Nevertheless, there is little question that their national relationship is weakening.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Mr. Trump successfully goes through with his plan, and expels the population of Gaza into Egypt and other Arab countries, Mr. Sisi will have to deal with a whole new set of problems. Thus, Egypt is stuck in a place where every step it takes to protect its interests, further endangers its relationship with one of its most important allies. Regardless of whatever small gains Egypt manages to eke out of this horrible situtation, Mr. Sisi seems destined to be worse off after this crisis than he was before.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/world/asia/china-marriage-companies-childbirth.html">When “Other Duties as Assigned” Takes on a Whole New Meaning</a></h3>
<p>Vivian Wang reports in The New York Times that companies in the People’s Republic of China are attempting to regulate the reproductive lives of their workers. One particularly egregious memo, sent by Shandong Shuntian Chemical Group, informs employees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘If you cannot get married and start a family within three quarters, the company will terminate your labor contract[.]’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peoples’ personal livelihoods are being upended by the P.R.C.’s newly pro-natalist politics. To those of us who believe in individual autonomy and reproductive justice, this is obviously dystopian.</p>
<p>But at second glance, something else stands out: President Xi’s administration isn’t asking the companies mentioned in this article to fire unmarried employees. To the contrary, the Times reports that the government has criticized several such actions.</p>
<p>Given the inherent <a href="https://cosmosandtaxis.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sieo_1_2008_andersson.pdf">Hayekian limitations</a> of a government attempting to regulate all aspects of its citizens’ lives, delegating responsibility for personally intrusive actions makes sense. What is truly impressive, however, is that private companies are apparently choosing to preemptively act in support of governmental priorities. A government whose policies are supported by organizations and people under its jurisdiction is strong; a government whose priorities are extrapolated into policy by independent actors is terrifyingly effective.</p>

<h4 class="postInfo">Published March 1, 2025</h4>
</div>
<p>In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sat down at the negotiating table in Munich and unilaterally surrendered the Sudetenland without Czech consent or input. This action, often associated with the negative label “appeasement” in the public eye, may not have been nearly as naive as it has been made out to be. Many sources indicate that, rather than believing his own claim to achieving “peace in our time,” Mr. Chamberlain was executing a careful maneuver designed to buy the U.K. time to prepare for war with Germany.</p>
<p>Regardless of Mr. Chamberlain’s intentions, his willingness to unilaterally surrender the territory of a U.K. ally was long remembered; in some quarters, the Munich Agreement is still known as the <a href="https://kafkadesk.org/2021/09/30/on-this-day-in-1938-the-munich-betrayal-sanctioned-germanys-annexation-of-the-sudetenland/">Munich Betrayal</a>.</p>
<p>In the weeks since he took office, American President Donald Trump has been following the path set out by Mr. Chamberlain, in regard to Ukraine. The United States has been a major benefactor of Ukraine, which has relied on Western countries to provide military and financial support to its war effort since it was invaded by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022. Since Mr. Trump has returned to office, however, he has not only threatened to terminate support for Ukraine but has initiated peace proceedings with the Russians while <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-he-and-putin-have-agreed-to-begin-negotiations-on-ending-ukraine-war">keeping the Ukrainians away</a> from the negotiating table.</p>
<p>There are reasons to believe that Ukraine should negotiate with the Russians at this juncture. Although Ukraine’s efforts to reclaim land seized by the Russians have slowed, its seizure of land in <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine’s-kursk-incursion-six-month-assessment">Kursk Oblast last summer</a> illustrated its enduring military capability and provided it with a vital bargaining chip in peace negotiations with the Russians. If Ukraine were to negotiate for peace by itself, or with the backing of its allies, it might well be in a reasonably strong negotiating position.</p>
<p>President Trump claims he wants to lead these peace negotiations, but, like Chamberlain selling out the Sudetenland at Munich, he seems uninterested in negotiating in partnership with the Ukrainians. In the weeks since Mr. Trump took office, he has engaged in rhetorical attacks on Ukraine and threatened to withhold future financial aid. President Vladimir Putin must be salivating at the prospect of  a world in which Ukraine, unsupported by its American allies, has no choice but to offer him favorable terms and solidify his control over the Crimean peninsula, the Donbas, and the captured portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.</p>
<p>On Friday, the American abandonment of Ukraine worsened. Mr. Trump held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMNAos1hotI&amp;t=21s">contentious Oval Office</a> meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Over the course of several minutes, Mr. Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance insulted and belittled the Ukrainian leader. They made false claims about Ukraine and the war itself, even while Mr. Trump claimed that he was “aligned with the world,” and supportive of a peaceful global environment. Yet Mr. Trump seems fundamentally unaware of the realities of global politics, refusing to seriously consider the possibility of Mr. Putin violating a ceasefire agreement, and claiming ignorance about the basic facts of the war.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump doesn’t lack sources willing to provide him with information about the war, either; the United States fields some of the world’s premier intelligence agencies and has globally renowned experts available to analyze information for the President around the clock. Perhaps Mr. Trump wishes to revenge himself against Mr. Zelenskyy, who featured prominently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump">in his first impeachment</a>. Perhaps he prefers Mr. Putin’s personality, or thinks he leads a stronger state. Perhaps – and I would hesitate to write this if not for the sheer childishness of the insults Mr. Trump hurled at Mr. Zelenskyy during their meeting yesterday – he is simply in cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Although international politics allows state leaders to exert their personal feelings on the world stage, that does not mean it is wise policy. Regardless of Mr. Trump’s opinions about Mr. Zelenskyy, the war in Ukraine has been broadly beneficial to the United States. The U.S. has invested <a href="https://fullfact.org/news/us-assistance-ukraine/">U.S.D. $119.5 billion</a> in Ukraine, a relatively small sum of money that has effectively bogged down Russian military capability. Russian surpluses of weapons dating back to the days of the Soviet Union have been depleted; the smaller state’s reduced borders and smaller population seem unlikely to allow it to fully replenish the full supply of weapons it had prior to the war.</p>
<p>Alongside their factually inaccurate statements about the origins of the war, Mr. Trump and his allies in the media raise legitimate concerns about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/20/1112414884/corruption-concerns-involving-ukraine-are-revived-as-the-war-with-russia-drags-o">Ukrainian corruption</a>. While there is little doubt that a great deal of corruption is present in Ukraine, it is indisputable that American and European support has been instrumental to Ukraine’s continued resilience. In other words, the money given to Ukraine for its defense <em>is</em> being used by Ukraine for its defense.</p>
<p>Yet despite the fact that the United States has the United States shouldn’t be negotiating with Ukraine for a rare earths deal; it should be unilaterally supporting the effective neutralization of one of its most dangerous adversaries. President Trump’s willingness to undermine a U.S. ally seriously endangers American interests. Conducting diplomacy in front of television cameras is not only ineffective, it undermines the image of the United States as a reliable international partner.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump can either grow up and work with Ukraine to bring the war to its conclusion, as he claims to want, or he can follow the path of Mr. Chamberlain and negotiate an end to the war that leaves the Ukrainians out in the cold, undermines American interests, and threatens the image of the United States as a trustworthy and valuable international partner.</p>

<h4 class="postInfo">Published February 28, 2025</h4>
</div>
<p><em>For those of you who were able to attend my TrumpScript presentation on Friday, </em><strong><em>thank you!</em></strong><em> As promised, here is a more detailed technical report on the language.</em></p>
<p>TrumpScript is a concurrently compiled, statically typed, and procedural programming language written in Swift and C++. Unlike single-pass languages, TrumpScript is designed for parallel compilation. Because of an extended development process, TrumpScript has several different versions. For the sake of this discussion, I will refer to these variants as Implementations A, B, and C. While these are not implementations in the typical sense of the word – there are significant differences between each – they do share similar concepts and some code. Implementation A is interpolated only; Implementation B is incomplete. Implementation C, which was presented on Friday, should be considered the canonical version of TrumpScript.</p>
<p>In Implementation A, function, symbol, type, and operator tables are generated concurrently, and code is executed sequentially. Implementation A supports limited interpreter action, including function calls. Implementation C, on the other hand, is compiled using an L.L.V.M. intermediate representation (I.R.).</p>
<h2>Using TrumpScript</h2>
<p>TrumpScript is extremely C-like in nature. The terminology of TrumpScript, however, reflects its status as a satirical language. To declare a new constant, use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>fact foo = 12
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, a variable can be declared as follows:</p>
<pre><code>altfact bar = 12
</code></pre>
<p>Explicit type declarations are not needed in TrumpScript; types are implicitly identified. To create a disfunction, simply type:</p>
<pre><code>disfunc some() -&gt; Huge {

    indict 32

}
</code></pre>
<p>The language is relatively simple, but it is quickly developing as I continue to expand the standard library (std in TrumpScript parlance). Loading in a file from the std is relatively simple, as demonstrated here with the math module:</p>
<pre><code>tariff math
</code></pre>
<p>TrumpScript is capable of performing basic operations. In Implementations A and B, the programmer is able to define custom operators. This is a long-term goal for the current implementation, but is not yet complete. Similarly, although functions can be called in implementations A and B, function calling is not currently supported in implementation C. Steps have been made to rectify this situation, but I am not there quite yet.</p>
<p>TrumpScript operators are quite adept, and are able to differentiate between different input and output types, acknowledge precedence, and more. Thus the function</p>
<pre><code>@main disfunc main() -&gt; Huge {

    indict 1 + 3 * 12 + 6

}
</code></pre>
<p>would indict a value of <code>43</code> when called. Supported types currently include <code>Huge</code> (a 64-bit integer value), <code>Claim</code> (a boolean value, which may be set either to <code>wrong</code> or <code>right</code>), and <code>Covfefe</code> (a double-precision floating-point value). Custom type support is a possible future direction for Implementation C, and one supported to some extent by Implementation A.</p>
<h2>Concurrent Compilation Background</h2>
<p>For Implementation A’s concurrent interpretation of TrumpScript, I made use of concurrency features in the Swift programming language. These features were introduced to Swift relatively recently, but enable safe and modern concurrent approaches.</p>
<p>Implementations A and C both make use of async/await. Async/await is a model for achieving task-based concurrency. In an asynchronous await model, programmers identify points where it is safe to suspend execution on one function and resume or start execution on another.</p>
<p>The async/await paradigm does not inherently make code multithreaded. The purpose of the async/await model instead ensures that multithreaded coding is thread-safe. By defining arbitrary points where execution can be suspended, async/await ensures that the programmer does not need to worry about execution being suspended at other points. Yet although the paradigm is mostly effective, it does not guarantee thread safety: even when using async/await, race conditions remain possible.</p>
<p>Async/await is a relatively new approach to concurrency, developed during the aughts. The paradigm’s greatest benefit is that it can be added to code relatively easily, with minimal boilerplate code. Nevertheless, the async/await model continues to be improved. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2019.03.002">Haller et al. 2019</a> identified future improvements which could be made to the model, specifically by integrating async/await with observable objects, in order to enable asynchronous streams of programming.</p>
<p>In Swift, the async/await model allows for another key programming paradigm to be introduced: the actor. As explained by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3001886.3001890">De Koster et al. 2016</a>, actors rely on a principle of isolation. Actors help prevent race conditions by preventing their internal state from being written to by anything other than their own functions. Moreover, actors may only execute a single function at a time; any function called on an actor is added to a sequentially executed queue. This means that although actors are thread-safe, they can be performance bottlenecks for multithreaded code.</p>
<p>Swift’s implementation of actors is relatively intuitive. Unfortunately, however, the constraints inherent to using actors make converting an existing type into an actor a disfavorable proposition. Nevertheless, actors are found in all implementations of TrumpScript, and are key to enabling multithreaded interpretation and compilation.</p>
<p>Although actors and async/await options are useful for ensuring thread safety, they do not enable concurrency by themselves. Swift allows programmers the options of directly creating threads, as well as a task model.</p>
<p>Swift’s task model provides a useful abstraction for threads; it can make use of so-called ”virtual threads” and manages the actual number of threads used based on available system resources. Tasks can be created within the context of any function, but for optimal performance, it is best to create them within a TaskGroup, which can be instructed to execute its tasks in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>In Implementation A, for example, a TaskGroup is used to effectively construct an implicit barrier guaranteeing specific state promises before executing it constructs the symbol table. A similar approach is intended for use with Implementation C, which already has actors and async/await compliant functions ready for use.</p>
<h2>Language Development</h2>
<p>All TrumpScript implementations build lookup tables early in the compilation or interpretation process. These lookup tables use a combination of sets and dictionaries, both of which have <code>O(1)</code> performance time in Swift when used to look up values.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, Swift’s sets and dictionaries are not thread-safe. In order to use them safely, I include them either as properties in actors, or, as in one case in Implementation C, on a class restricted to use on a single thread. This approach allows me to safely use these high performance structures despite their lack of multithreaded safety guarantees.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, there is significant overlap between different implementations of TrumpScript. This overlap is particularly noteworthy in the first part of compilation: the lexer.</p>
<p>Tokenizing and delineating code is the first step in all three implementations of TrumpScript. The design of tokens has evolved significantly, however; whereas Implementations A and B used custom token enumerations, Implementation C uses a simple structure wrapper around a text value associated with dozens of computed boolean properties. This approach allows me to easily and elegantly adjust my regex matching without needing to worry about multiple occurrences of the same check throughout my codebase.</p>
<p>All variants of TrumpScript are careful to record user-observed line numbers. This is used to ensure high-quality error checks, particularly in Implementations A and B. (Implementation C currently relies on a whole lot of <code>fatalError(:_)</code> calls, but this is expected to change in the near future.)</p>
<p>Parallel compilation is not yet fully functional for implementation C, but it is almost ready, and will follow the design used in Implementation A, which builds tables in several groups: in each group, tables are generated independently; each group has dependencies on tables introduced in earlier groups. Implementation A uses a <code>generate()</code> function to prepare for interpretation; Implementation C uses a similar <code>compile(:_)</code> function to pipeline the TrumpScript code to machine code.</p>
<p>Although traditional strong/weak scalability testing is not appropriate for task-based concurrency, the parallel version of the <code>generate()</code> method in Implementation A is noticeably faster than the linear version, despite the fact that they ultimately perform the exact same tasks. Performance improvements can be measured by analyzing the time taken to complete all code in the generate method. Over multiple tests, performance improvements in the parallel version averaged 23 percent faster than the linear equivalent.</p>
<p>To enable compilation in Implementation C, I made use of the L.L.V.M. abstract assembly language. L.L.V.M. is an efficient approach to compilation because of its broad usage, robust support, and plentiful compiler targets. Rather than using L.L.V.M. code generation options, I opted to generate I.R. through my own files and pass my IR directly to the L.L.V.M. code, which I called from my C++ file. In turn, Swift was able to call my C++ function thanks to a bridging header.</p>
<p>In order to maximize the efficiency of my compiled code, I have the L.L.V.M. A.P.I. perform multiple optimization passes to fold constants, to remove unnecessary stack allocations, and to maximize computational speed and efficiency. All told, the resulting assembly code is remarkably efficient.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The satire and technical complexity of TrumpScript have made it an exciting project. I imagine I will continue working on it in the future. But even at its current state, quite a few people deserve thanks for their part in bringing it to life.</p>
<p>My thanks to the advice and support of Professors Paul Cantrell, Libby Shoop, Jed Carlson, and Lauren Milne, all of Macalester College. Thank you to the many people who suggested hilarious terminology and laughed alongside me as I worked on the language and my presentation. Building such a complex system is no simple feat, and I couldn’t have it without so many wonderful people working alongside me.</p>
<p>Finally, thank you to my brother, Milo, who flew halfway across the United States to see me present TrumpScript. It’s been great hanging out with you, and thank you for putting up with me.</p>

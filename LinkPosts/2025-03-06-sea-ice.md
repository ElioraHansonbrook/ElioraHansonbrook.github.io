### [Record Low Sea Ice](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-global-sea-ice-cover-record-low-and-third-warmest-february-globally)
Like the opening montage of a bad science fiction film, each new scene in the climate change saga seems worse than the last. The European Union's Copernicus Programme reports:
> Daily global sea ice extent, which combines the sea ice extents in both polar regions, reached a new all-time minimum in early February and remained below the previous record of February 2023 for the rest of the month.
Despite repeated efforts to curb the effects of climate change, the anomalous worsening observed over the past several years seems to indicate we haven't done enough. Despite the nearly thirty COPs which have been held over the past several decades, and despite progress made at Cairo and Paris, humanity seems stuck on the "business as usual" path.
